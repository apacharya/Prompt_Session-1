The one-pager should provide brief summaries about these articles but ensure to communicate information that is relevant to the groups. For instance, the AI engineering team might care more about technical details/advancements and the executive team might care more about high-level trends and insights. You get to define this yourself when designing the prompt. \n",

    "We need scientific and technical breakthroughs to steer and control AI systems much smarter than us. To solve this problem within four years, we’re starting a new team, co-led by Ilya Sutskever and Jan Leike, and dedicating 20% of the compute we’ve secured to date to this effort. We’re looking for excellent ML researchers and engineers to join us.\n",
    "\n",
    "Superintelligence will be the most impactful technology humanity has ever invented, and could help us solve many of the world’s most important problems. But the vast power of superintelligence could also be very dangerous, and could lead to the disempowerment of humanity or even human extinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "While superintelligence seems far off now, we believe it could arrive this decade.\n",
    "Managing these risks will require, among other things, new institutions for governance and solving the problem of superintelligence alignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we ensure AI systems much smarter than humans follow human intent?\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we don't have a solution for steering or controlling a potentially superintelligent AI, and preventing it from going rogue. Our current techniques for aligning AI, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, rely on humans’ ability to supervise AI. But humans won’t be able to reliably supervise AI systems much smarter than us, and so our current alignment techniques will not scale to superintelligence. We need new scientific and technical breakthroughs.\n",
    "Our approach\n",
    "Our goal is to build a roughly human-level automated alignment researcher. We can then use vast amounts of compute to scale our efforts, and iteratively align superintelligence.\n",
    "To align the first automated alignment researcher, we will need to 1) develop a scalable training method, 2) validate the resulting model, and 3) stress test our entire alignment pipeline:\n",
    "To provide a training signal on tasks that are difficult for humans to evaluate, we can leverage AI systems to assist evaluation of other AI systems (scalable oversight). In addition, we want to understand and control how our models generalize our oversight to tasks we can’t supervise (generalization).\n",
    "To validate the alignment of our systems, we automate search for problematic behavior (robustness) and problematic internals (automated interpretability).\n",
    "Finally, we can test our entire pipeline by deliberately training misaligned models, and confirming that our techniques detect the worst kinds of misalignments (adversarial testing).\n",
    "We expect our research priorities will evolve substantially as we learn more about the problem and we’ll likely add entirely new research areas. We are planning to share more on our roadmap in the future.\n",
    "The new team\n",
    "We are assembling a team of top machine learning researchers and engineers to work on this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are dedicating 20% of the compute we’ve secured to date over the next four years to solving the problem of superintelligence alignment. Our chief basic research bet is our new Superalignment team, but getting this right is critical to achieve our mission and we expect many teams to contribute, from developing new methods to scaling them up to deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this is an incredibly ambitious goal and we’re not guaranteed to succeed, we are optimistic that a focused, concerted effort can solve this problem: There are many ideas that have shown promise in preliminary experiments, we have increasingly useful metrics for progress, and we can use today’s models to study many of these problems empirically. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ilya Sutskever (cofounder and Chief Scientist of OpenAI) has made this his core research focus, and will be co-leading the team with Jan Leike (Head of Alignment). Joining the team are researchers and engineers from our previous alignment team, as well as researchers from other teams across the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’re also looking for outstanding new researchers and engineers to join this effort. Superintelligence alignment is fundamentally a machine learning problem, and we think great machine learning experts—even if they’re not already working on alignment—will be critical to solving it.\n",
    "We plan to share the fruits of this effort broadly and view contributing to alignment and safety of non-OpenAI models as an important part of our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "This new team’s work is in addition to existing work at OpenAI aimed at improving the safety of current models like ChatGPT, as well as understanding and mitigating other risks from AI such as misuse, economic disruption, disinformation, bias and discrimination, addiction and overreliance, and others. While this new team will focus on the machine learning challenges of aligning superintelligent AI systems with human intent, there are related sociotechnical problems on which we are actively engaging with interdisciplinary experts to make sure our technical solutions consider broader human and societal concerns.\n",

    "Article 2:\n",
    "Claude 2\n",
    "\n",
    "We are pleased to announce Claude 2, our new model. Claude 2 has improved performance, longer responses, and can be accessed via API as well as a new public-facing beta website, claude.ai. We have heard from our users that Claude is easy to converse with, clearly explains its thinking, is less likely to produce harmful outputs, and has a longer memory. We have made improvements from our previous models on coding, math, and reasoning. For example, our latest model scored 76.5% on the multiple choice section of the Bar exam, up from 73.0% with Claude 1.3. When compared to college students applying to graduate school, Claude 2 scores above the 90th percentile on the GRE reading and writing exams, and similarly to the median applicant on quantitative reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Claude as a friendly, enthusiastic colleague or personal assistant who can be instructed in natural language to help you with many tasks. The Claude 2 API for businesses is being offered for the same price as Claude 1.3. Additionally, anyone in the US and UK can start using our beta chat experience today.\n",
    "As we work to improve both the performance and safety of our models, we have increased the length of Claude’s input and output. Users can input up to 100K tokens in each prompt, which means that Claude can work over hundreds of pages of technical documentation or even a book. Claude can now also write longer documents - from memos to letters to stories up to a few thousand tokens - all in one go.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, our latest model has greatly improved coding skills. Claude 2 scored a 71.2% up from 56.0% on the Codex HumanEval, a Python coding test. On GSM8k, a large set of grade-school math problems, Claude 2 scored 88.0% up from 85.2%. We have an exciting roadmap of capability improvements planned for Claude 2 and will be slowly and iteratively deploying them in the coming months.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've been iterating to improve the underlying safety of Claude 2, so that it is more harmless and harder to prompt to produce offensive or dangerous output. We have an internal red-teaming evaluation that scores our models on a large representative set of harmful prompts, using an automated test while we also regularly check the results manually. In this evaluation, Claude 2 was 2x better at giving harmless responses compared to Claude 1.3. Although no model is immune from jailbreaks, we’ve used a variety of safety techniques (which you can read about here and here), as well as extensive red-teaming, to improve its outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude 2 powers our chat experience, and is generally available in the US and UK. We are working to make Claude more globally available in the coming months. You can now create an account and start talking to Claude in natural language, asking it for help with any tasks that you like. Talking to an AI assistant can take some trial and error, so read up on our tips to get the most out of Claude.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are also currently working with thousands of businesses who are using the Claude API. One of our partners is Jasper, a generative AI platform that enables individuals and teams to scale their content strategies. They found that Claude 2 was able to go head to head with other state of the art models for a wide variety of use cases, but has particular strength for long form low latency uses. \"We are really happy to be among the first to offer Claude 2 to our customers, bringing enhanced semantics, up-to-date knowledge training, improved reasoning for complex prompts, and the ability to effortlessly remix existing content with a 3X larger context window,\" said Greg Larson, VP of Engineering at Jasper. \"We are proud to help our customers stay ahead of the curve through partnerships like this one with Anthropic.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Sourcegraph is a code AI platform that helps customers write, fix, and maintain code. Their coding assistant Cody uses Claude 2’s improved reasoning ability to give even more accurate answers to user queries while also passing along more codebase context with up to 100K context windows. In addition, Claude 2 was trained on more recent data, meaning it has knowledge of newer frameworks and libraries for Cody to pull from. “When it comes to AI coding, devs need fast and reliable access to context about their unique codebase and a powerful LLM with a large context window and strong general reasoning capabilities,” says Quinn Slack, CEO & Co-founder of Sourcegraph. “The slowest and most frustrating parts of the dev workflow are becoming faster and more enjoyable. Thanks to Claude 2, Cody’s helping more devs build more software that pushes the world forward.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We welcome your feedback as we work to responsibly deploy our products more broadly. Our chat experience is an open beta launch, and users should be aware that Claude – like all current models – can generate inappropriate responses. AI assistants are most useful in everyday situations, like serving to summarize or organize information, and should not be used where physical or mental health and well-being are involved. Please let us know if you’d like to talk to Claude in a currently unsupported area, or if you are a business who would like to start working with Claude.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Check the tracking details: While the tracking information may not have been updated recently, it's still worth checking for any available details.
